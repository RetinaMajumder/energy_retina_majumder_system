🌱 Advanced Sustainable Electricity Generation Simulator
An interactive Streamlit web app for simulating and optimizing electricity generation using:
1️⃣ Geothermal + Wasted Energy Recovery System
2️⃣ Mountain-Attached Waterfall Turbine System

The app allows users to explore clean energy outputs, adjust parameters, and view AI-optimized solutions for maximum sustainability.

✨ Features
Geothermal + Waste Recovery Module

Calculate thermal and electric power from geothermal wells.

Model wasted energy recovery with AI-optimized fractions.

Estimate households powered annually.

Waterfall Turbine Module

Simulate hydroelectric output from waterfall-attached turbines.

Adjustable flow rate, height, and turbine efficiency.

Summary Dashboard

Combined outputs from all sources.

Stacked bar chart & line chart visualizations.

Export results to CSV.

Add prototype/diagram links (GitHub, Google Drive).

⚙️ Technologies Used
Python (core logic & calculations)

Streamlit (UI & web app framework)

NumPy / Pandas (data processing)

Matplotlib (visualizations)

🚀 Getting Started
🔧 Installation
Clone this repository and install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/<RetinaMajumder>/<energy_retina_majumder_system>.git
cd <energy_retina_majumder_system>
pip install -r requirements.txt
▶️ Run the app
bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
📊 Example Outputs
Geothermal + Waste System: Thermal power, electricity generated, annual energy, households powered.

Waterfall Turbine: Power output, annual energy, households powered.

Combined View: Total kW, kWh/year, and households powered with charts.

🧠 AI Optimization
The app includes an AI-simulated optimization module that suggests the best fraction of wasted electricity recovery to meet a target power output.
